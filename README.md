# Fuzzy_CMean_VS__Kmean

This repository contains a comparison of different algorithms using a diabetes dataset. The project includes preprocessing steps such as removing outliers and normalizing features, and implements algorithms from scratch, including:
- K-Means
- Fuzzy C-Means
- SVM algorithms


## Dataset
The diabetes dataset used in this project is a commonly used dataset for machine learning and data analysis tasks. It contains various medical measurements such as blood pressure, insulin levels, and body mass index, as well as a column indicating whether the patient has diabetes. The dataset is often used to predict diabetes in patients based on these measurements. The dataset contains several features, including numerical variables such as age, and binary variables indicating the presence or absence of certain medical conditions. The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not. It is important to note that the dataset may have missing values or outliers, so preprocessing steps such as handling missing data and removing outliers may be necessary before building models.

## Results
The final results of the algorithm comparison can be found in the Notebook.
